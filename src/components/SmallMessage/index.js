        <h2>What to Expect</h2>

        <p>
          There is something happening every day at GEBC Gbagada, but when you
          join us on Sunday you can expect a strong and challenging message
          coupled with biblical worship. When you arrive, youâ€™ll be welcome into
          a friendly environment by people who are excited to see you. We look
          forward to meeting you!
